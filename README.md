- 👋 Hi, I’m @francrom.
- 👀 I’m interested in web development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Elixir + Phoenix, Ruby on Rails, Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source web projects (eventually!), especially those that bypass the use of js.
- 📫 How to reach me? I'll link my portfolio here, when it's good and ready!
